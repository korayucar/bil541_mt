# --------------------- 0- Notes and remarks --------------------- 
#
# - Limitations:
#    - Human is always the first player. Computer is always the second player.
#
# - Assumptions:
#       When each player takes 26 cards no majority card points awarded. Game ends with 13 points + pistis.
# - Usage:
#       - Run:
#               python midterm.py
#       You will be prompted your hand and the cards in the middle. Write the index of your card
#       you want to play(0,1,2,3), then press enter. Wait for computer's move. Repeat until end.
#       The scores you see in the last prompt are final scores. When computer plays a taking move
#       The cards on the ground will disappear in the next prompt. It is a bit confusing but 
#       working as intended.
#
# - How will you verify that the algorithm is better than random?
#       - It is better than random. Play the 0 index card constantly. You should see computer 
#         winning most of the games this way.
#       - Alternatively, see test_play_many_game_against_random_player_and_print_stats() method.
#         This test is run when TEST parameter is set to True. Takes 5-10 min time to run though.
#         output from when I ran it:
#              "Out of 20 games, random player won 136 points. smarter AI won 271 points."
#      
# - See the code if you need to verify the game logic. I am not providing methodology to configure
#   cards dealt. When script starts, a random deck is shuffled. The shuffled deck is consistent
#   throughout the game.
#   
# - Algorithm outline
#       1- At any point suggest_next_card_to_play(...) method generates 
#          many(count configurable below) possible hands for the opponent
#       2- For each opponent hand generated, the game is forked many times to generate 
#          every possible sequence until the end of current round(i.e at most 4!*4! continuations). 
#          Here game forking means creating alternate games where we assign random(but possible)
#          cards to the opponent.
#       3- For each possible continuation to the end of current round(i.e. one of 6 rounds in a game),
#          expected score for the rest of the whole game is estimated (heuristics). (Up to 
#          <number of guessed opponent hands> * 4! * 4! many round end estimations made.)
#       4- Finally, the card that is best to play against most opponent hands is chosen. The end goal 
#          of the optimization is configurable. See OPTIMIZE_FOR_MORE_POINTS_THAN_OPPONENT_IN_SINGLE_GAME
#          vs OPTIMIZE_FOR_MAX_POINTS_IN_SINGLE_GAME parameters below.
# - I have not written rounds to text files. I did not get what writing to files is for.
